_"Alessandro Miani et al. have built a dataset to study the language of conspiracy theories. Starting with a set of phrases associated with major conspiracy theories (e.g., those surrounding Princess Diana’s death), the authors searched online for sources that mentioned them often, ultimately selecting 150 websites — both mainstream and conspiracy-laden — that met their criteria. Then, in mid-2020, they collected 72,000+ topical articles from those sites. For each article, the project includes its text, lexical features, and metadata."_
